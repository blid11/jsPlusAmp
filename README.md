## Implementation of tutorial for AWS amplify: set up a fullstack project: 
https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/setup/q/integration/react/
-AWS amplify allows one to scale an app written with react. 

# Running App.js locally: 
npx create-react-app react-amplified
cd react-amplified
npm start

# Hosting App.js on AWS Amplify
Hosting the app with AWS Amplify allows one to add a variety of features (User Authentication, User Interfaces, storage of user data) and to scale resources as needed for additional users. Collaborators can edit the front end and back end features with an AWS AccessID; either through Amplify studio or via the command line.
